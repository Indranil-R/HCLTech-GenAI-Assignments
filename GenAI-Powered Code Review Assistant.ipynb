    "# GenAI-Powered Code Review Assistant\n",
    "This is an AI agent that reviews code in real-time. It accepts code snippets in Python, Java, and other languages, generates feedback, suggests improvements, detects security flaws, and auto-suggests documentation using an LLM like Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, or GPT-4 Turbo. It integrates into a Git-based workflow by posting PR comments on platforms like GitHub. It also uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to reference best coding practices from internal documentation."
